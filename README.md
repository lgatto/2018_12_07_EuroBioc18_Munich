# A Grammar of Omics Data Manipulation - a tale of two cultures

- My talk at [EuroBioc 2018](https://bioconductor.github.io/EuroBioc2018/)
- When: Fri 7 Dec, 11:15am



The idea of two cultures, originally coined by CP Snow referring to
the sciences and the humanities has been re-used countless time to
contrast two, sometimes contradicting or opposing views, of a culture
or domain. Obviously, R doesn't escape this pattern, and that are
numerous complementary (opposing?) views when it comes to
object-oriented programming (S3 vs S4; S4 vs R5 (Reference classes) vs
R6, ...), visualisation (base vs lattice vs ggplot2), data analysis
(base vs tidyverse), ... Apparently, there are also two tendencies
when it comes to analysing genomics data and using rich data
containers as provided by the Bioconductor project, and having a
smooth data analysis pipeline and consistent vocabulary as celebrated
by the tidyverse tools.
